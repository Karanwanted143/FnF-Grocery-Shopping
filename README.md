LITERATURE REVIEW 
 
2.1 Existing System 
 
An existing system refers to the currently operational or in-use software, hardware, or processes that fulfill specific functions or tasks within an organization or for a particular purpose. It is the system that is already in place before any changes or improvements are made. When conducting a review of an existing system, you typically assess its strengths, weaknesses, functionality, and efficiency.

2.2 Drawbacks of Existing System 

Your literature overview is a comprehensive and well-structured plan for researching and understanding the various aspects of the grocery order website industry, which is highly relevant for your FnF Grocery Website for vegetables and fruits.

1. E-Commerce and Food Industry: Investigate how e-commerce has influenced the grocery industry, particularly in the context of selling vegetables and fruits online. Explore studies that highlight the growth of online grocery shopping and consumer preferences for fresh produce delivery.

2. User Experience (UX) Design :  Emphasize the importance of user-friendly design in an online grocery store. Review research that specifically addresses UX principles for grocery e-commerce, such as intuitive navigation, product presentation, and checkout processes.
3. Grocery Store Management : In the context of a grocery website, delve into literature related to inventory management, product categorization, and order fulfilment specifically tailored to fresh produce. Address unique challenges such as perishability and quality control.

4. Delivery Logistics : Investigate how delivery logistics can be optimized for grocery delivery, including considerations for maintaining the freshness of vegetables and fruits during transit. Look for research on efficient route planning and delivery scheduling.

5. Marketing and Promotions : Explore digital marketing strategies that are effective for promoting an online grocery store, including how to highlight the quality and freshness of your products. Consider loyalty programs and referral systems that encourage repeat business.

6. Scalability and Technology Stack : Given the perishable nature of your products, scalability and a robust technology stack are crucial. Research how grocery e-commerce platforms handle scalability and which technology choices are best suited for your needs.

7. Global Trends and Emerging Technologies : Stay updated on emerging trends in the online grocery industry, especially those related to fresh produce. This may include innovations in cold chain logistics, packaging technologies, or AI-driven inventory management.

8. User Behaviour and Preferences : Analyse how users shop for vegetables and fruits online, including their preferences for product descriptions, images, and delivery



 SYSTEM DESIGN DETAILS 

4.1 Water-Fall Model
                
This Model was proposed by “Winston Royce”. It is also called as a classic life cycle. It suggests systematic sequential approach for software development. Water-Fall model is the absolute first model that is utilized in Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
	In this model, the result of one phase is the contribution for the following phase. Advancement of the following phase begins just when the past phase is finished. First, requirement gathering is done and the design stage begins and so it goes on with rest of the stages.
